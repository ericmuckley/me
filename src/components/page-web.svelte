                I was the lead developer of the original version of CRIPT, the Community Resource for Innovation in Polymer Technology,
                which is a collaborative project funded by the National Science Foundation.
                CRIPT serves as a hub for sharing polymer data and utilizes
                interactive visuals, search tools, and plotting utilities.

            I was the sole developer of a cloud-based simulator for sequential learning analytics,
            in which users could estimate throughput, cost, and time associated with lab-based processing
            of multiple material samples. Design of experiments was carried out through sequential learning,
            in which a trained machine learning model was used to select a candidate for future experiments,
            and measured properties of the selected candidate were fed back into the model to improve its
            performance for the next iteration.

                instantly see statistics, histograms, and interactive plots which enable exloration of the dataset.

        I have been the lead developer on several large-scale web application projects, including 
        frontend design and engineering, backend engineeering, API creation, data schema development,
        and database configuration and management. One example is this site: it is a single-page application 
        which I build from scratch without using a frontend framework like React or Angular.
